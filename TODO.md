# To Do
* Clean up/refactor
* Eliminate the use of `pandas`
* Document
* Test cases
* Make `setup.py` put the files in `data` somewhere accessible
* Optimize (big frequencies)
* Work out a theory of mixed triangle & quad grids other than Class I. (Triangle (1,1) seems to work with square (2,1), for instance, while square (1,1) doesn't seem to work with any triangle breakdown.) (Stitch the frame instead of the vertices?)
* Allow arbitrary face figures other than SGS (would probably need whole new program)
