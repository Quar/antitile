In the geodesic dome world, geometry is usually synthetic rather than
analytic. That is, geometric constructions are usually expressed in terms of
step-by-step geometric constructions rather than in equations and numeric
values. See, for instance, \cite{kenner}. Implementing a synthetic geometric
construction on a computer can be a pain; analytic specifications are more
amenable to programming idioms.

\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Spherical geometry}
There are a number of ways to numerically specify points on a sphere. By far
the most common is by latitude and longitude, which appear on every modern map
of the Earth and probably some other planets. Latitude and longitude are
familiar and convenient, but performing extended geometry calculations using
latitude and longitude is a complicated task.

Doing spherical geometry using a 3-component unit vector is more convenient
in a number of ways: the equations are often simpler, and there are no
singularities at the poles. A unit sphere can be defined as the set of all unit
vectors in 3-space; i.e., vectors $\mathbf v = [v_x, v_y, v_z]$ such that the
vector norm $\|\mathbf v \|=1$. Unit vectors are often denoted using a hat:
$\hat{\mathbf v}$. We'll often find ourselves normalizing vectors,
so we may supress the denominator with an ellipsis like so:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf v} = \frac{\mathbf{some+really+long+statement}}{\|\dots\|}
\end{equation}
If a vector is an intermediate step to a normalized vector,
we may call it pre-normalized and denote it ${\mathbf v}^*$,
such that $\hat{\mathbf v} = \frac{{\mathbf v}^*}{ \|{\mathbf v}^*\|}$

The shortest distance between two points in Euclidean space is a straight line.
On the sphere, the shortest distance is an arc of the great circle between those
points. The great circle is the intersection of the sphere and a plane passing
through the origin. A plane through the origin can be specified as
$\hat{\mathbf n} \cdot \mathbf v = 0$, where $\hat{\mathbf n}$ is a unit vector
normal to the plane; this vector $\hat{\mathbf n}$ can be used to specify a
great circle. Given two points $\mathbf{\hat{v}_1, \hat{v}_2}$ on the sphere,
the $\hat{\mathbf n}$ of the great circle between those two points is (up to
normalization) their cross product:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\hat{n}} =
\frac{\mathbf{\hat{v}}_1 \times \mathbf{\hat{v}}_2}{\|\dots\|}
\end{equation}

Small circles are the intersection of the sphere with a plane not through
the origin. All planes may be specified in Hessian normal form as
$\mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \mathbf v = r$, where $r$ is the minimum distance
between the plane and the origin. The intersection of the plane with the sphere
is determined by $r$ as so:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $r = 0$: Great circle
  \item $r \in (0,1)$: Small circle
  \item $r = 1$: Point
  \item $r > 1$: None
\end{itemize}

The following subsections give some formulas for measurements and constructions
in Euclidean space and on the sphere. Since a sphere is locally Euclidean, the
spherical formulas approach the Euclidean formulas when the measures are small.
Note that some spherical formulas require normalized vectors,
denoted by the hat $\mathbf{\hat{v}}$.

\subsubsection{Distance}
In Euclidean space, the distance between two vertices $\mathbf v_1$ and
$\mathbf v_2$ is given by the usual metric. On the sphere, distance is the
central angle $\theta$, which is given by many equivalent forms: the most
numerically stable one is the one using $\arctan$ given below.
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\eta & = \|\mathbf v_1-\mathbf v_2\| \\
\theta & = \arctan\left(
  \frac{\|\mathbf{\hat{v}}_1 \times \mathbf{\hat{v}}_2\|}
  {\mathbf{\hat{v}}_1 \cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}}_2}\right)
\end{split}\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Angle}
The angle on a surface at the vertex $v_1$ between $v_2$ and $v_3$ is a
standard expression for Euclidean space. For spheres, it is the dihedral angle
between the planes defined from $v_1$ to $v_2$ and from $v_1$ to $v_3$.
\begin{equation}
  \cos\phi_1 = \mathbf{\hat{c}}_{12} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{c}}_{13}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\hat{c}}_{ij} = \frac{\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j}{\|\dots\|}$
for Euclidean space and $\mathbf{\hat{c}}_{ij} = \frac{\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i
\times \mathbf{\hat{v}}_j}{\|\dots\|}$ for spheres. (This formula also has
equivalent forms using $\sin$ and $\tan$.)

\subsubsection{Area}
The area of an arbitrary polygon with vertices $v_i$ is given by the shoelace
formula. $n$ is the number of vertices in the polygon and
$i = 0 \dots n-1$ is an index for each vertex. $i$ should be treated as if it's
mod $n$, so that it loops around. This formula will give a result for skew
polygons, but the areas of skew polygons are not well-defined.
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{1}{2} \| \sum \mathbf v_i\times \mathbf v_{i+1} \|
\end{equation}
The area of a spherical triangle is the solid angle $\Omega$,
and given by a more elaborate formula. \cite{oosterom}\cite{eriksson}
\begin{equation}
\tan(\Omega/2) = \frac{|\mathbf{\hat{v}_1} \cdot
       \mathbf{\hat{v}}_2 \times \mathbf{\hat{v}}_3|}
       {1+\mathbf{\hat{v}}_1\cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}}_2+\mathbf{\hat{v}}_2
       \cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}}_3+\mathbf{\hat{v}}_3\cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}}_1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Means}
When $n=2$ this formula gives the midpoint between $\mathbf v_1$ and
$\mathbf v_2$. When $n=3$ it gives the centroid of the triangle with
vertices $\mathbf v_1, \mathbf v_2$ and $\mathbf v_3$.
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\mathbf v_\mu & = \frac{\sum\mathbf v_i}{n} \\
\mathbf{\hat{v}}_\mu & = \frac{\sum\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i}{\|\dots\|}
\end{split}\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Interpolation}
Interpolation in Euclidean space is standard linear interpolation. On the
sphere, interpolation is given by spherical linear interpolation, or slerp.
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\mathrm{Lerp}(\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}; t) & =
       (1-t) \mathbf{v_1} + t \mathbf{v_2} \\
\mathrm{Slerp}(\mathbf{\hat{v}_1}, \mathbf{\hat{v}_2}; t) & =
       \frac{\sin {((1-t)w)}}{\sin (w)} \mathbf{\hat{v}_1} +
       \frac{\sin (tw)}{\sin (w)} \mathbf{\hat{v}_2},
        w = \arccos \mathbf{\hat{v}_1} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{v}_2}
\end{split}\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Face normal}
For the purposes of this text, we define the normal to a (Euclidean) polygon as
so, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the polygon and
$i = 0 \dots n-1$ is an index for each vertex:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{n}} =
  \frac{\sum^{n-1}_i \mathbf{v}_i \times \mathbf{v}_{i+1}}{\|\dots\|}
\end{equation}
$i$ should be treated as if it's mod $n$, so that it loops around.
(Note the similarity to the shoelace formula.)
This definition allows for a somewhat sensible extension to skew polygons:
the normal points in a generally reasonable direction for skew polygons.
The normal will be outward-facing if the points are ordered counterclockwise,
and inward-facing if the points are ordered clockwise.

\subsubsection{Skewness}
There's no standard measure of polygon skewness, so this text uses an ad-hoc
measure that seems to work well. This program measures the skewness of a polygon
with 4 or more vertices by this method: Let $\mathbf x_i = \mathbf{v}_i -
\bar{\mathbf{v}}$, where $\bar{\mathbf{v}}$ is the (Euclidean) average of the
points. Calculate the SVD decomposition of the matrix that has $\mathbf x_i$
as rows (or columns). We only need the singular values: since we're in 3d
space, there will be 3 singular values. The \textit{skewness} is the smallest
singular value divided by the sum of the  other two singular values.
If the polygon is flat, the skewness is 0.

\caption{Barycentric coordinates. Left: Area opposite of each vertex. Right: Intersection of lines parallel with triangle edges.}
\label{fig:bary}
\end{figure}

This text will use barycentric coordinates to express Euclidean triangles.
Barycentric coordinates are real numbers $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ such that
$\sum^3_{i=1} \beta_i = 1$. Given a triangle with vertices $\mathbf v_1,
\mathbf v_2, \mathbf v_3$, the corresponding vertex is given by $\mathbf v =
\sum^3_{i=1} \beta_i \mathbf v_i$. Given $\mathbf v$ and $\mathbf v_i$,
$\beta_i$ can be found by e.g. solving the linear system of
$\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 = 1$ and $\mathbf v = \sum^3_{i=1} \beta_i \mathbf
v_i$. $\beta_i$ are all positive on the interior of the triangle. If a point
lies on an edge opposite vertex $i$, then $\beta_i$ is zero.
(If it lies beyond the edge, then $\beta_i < 0$.)

There are two geometric interpretations of barycentric coordinates that will be
useful, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:bary}. One is that $\beta_i$ is the area
of the smaller triangle opposite $v_i$ divided by the area of the large
triangle. The other is that if a line is placed passing through $v$ parallel to
the edge opposite vertex $i$, it will be at $\beta_i$ of the distance between
the edge and its opposite vertex, with $\beta_i = 0$ being on the edge itself.
Let $v_{i,j}$ be the point where the line for $i$ meets the line between
vertices $i$ and $j$: then the vertex lies $\frac{\beta_{j}}{1-\beta{i}}$
of the distance from $v_{i,j}$ to $v_{i,j+1}$.

Generalized barycentric coordinates are defined similarly, but the requirement
that $\sum^3_{i=1} \beta_i = 1$ is dropped. For instance, generalized
barycentric coordinates on the unit sphere replace it with a requirement that
$\| \sum^3_{i=1} \beta_i \mathbf v_i \| = 1$. $\sum^3_{i=1} \beta_i$ would be
$>1$ on the interior of the triangle, $=1$ on the edges, and $<1$ on the exterior.

Quadrilaterals are instead specified by what we'll call \textit{$uv$
coordinates} where $u$ and $v$ are $\in [0, 1]$. Given a quadrilateral with
vertices $\mathbf v_1, \mathbf v_2, \mathbf v_3, \mathbf v_4$, the
transformation is:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf v = \mathbf v_1 + (\mathbf v_2-\mathbf v_1) u + (\mathbf v_4-\mathbf v_1) v + (\mathbf v_1-\mathbf v_2+\mathbf v_3-\mathbf v_4)uv
\end{equation}
Unlike triangles, quadrilaterals may have points that do not share a common
plane: they may be skew quadrilaterals. If the quadrilateral is a skew
quadrilateral, $u$ and $v$ smoothly parameterize a surface over that skew
quadrilateral.

\section{Maps between Euclidean and spherical polygons}
\subsection{Conformal}

Schwarz triangle maps

\subsection{Gnomonic}
The gnomonic projection was known to the ancient Greeks, and is the simplest
of the transformations listed here. It has the nice property that all lines in
Euclidean space are transformed into great circles on the sphere: that is,
geodesics stay geodesics, and polygons stay polygons. This is in fact the
motivation for the name "geodesic dome": Fuller used this projection to project
triangles on the sphere. This is referred to as Method 1 in geodesic dome
terminology. The main downside is that the transformation causes shapes
near the corners to appear bunched up;
this is particularly bad for larger faces e.g. on the tetrahedron.

In general, the gnomonic projection is defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item To sphere: $\hat{\mathbf v} = \frac{\mathbf p}{\|\mathbf p\|}$
\item From sphere: $\mathbf p = \frac{r}
  {\hat{\mathbf n} \cdot \hat{\mathbf v}}\hat{\mathbf v}$
\end{itemize}

where $\mathbf p$ is a point on a plane given in Hessian normal
form by $\hat{\mathbf n} \cdot \mathbf p = r$. Projection from Euclidean
space to the sphere is literally just normalizing the vector. For the Goldberg-Coxeter operation, this amounts to just normalizing
the vectors produced by the coordinate form. For triangles:
\begin{equation}
   \mathbf v^* =
   \beta_1 \mathbf v_1 + \beta_2 \mathbf v_2 + \beta_3 \mathbf v_3
\end{equation}
For quadrilaterals:
\begin{equation}
   \mathbf v^* = \mathbf v_1 + (\mathbf v_2-\mathbf v_1) x +
   (\mathbf v_4-\mathbf v_1) y +
   (\mathbf v_1-\mathbf v_2+\mathbf v_3-\mathbf v_4)xy
 \end{equation}
where $\beta_i$ are (planar) barycentric coordinates and $x,y$ are
x-y quadrilateral coordinates.

The triangular case can be thought of in terms of generalized
barycentric coordinates. If the generalized coordinates are
$\beta^\prime_i$, then $\beta^\prime_i = \frac{\beta_1}
{\|\beta_1 \mathbf v_1 + \beta_2 \mathbf v_2 + \beta_3 \mathbf v_3\|}$.

\subsection{Spherical areal}
This method applies to triangles only. Instead we look to the relation between
barycentric coordinates and area; we treat $\beta_i$ as the proportion of
spherical area in the triangle that is opposite the vertex $\hat{\mathbf v}_i$.
Let $\Omega$ be the spherical area (solid angle) of the spherical triangle and
$\Omega_i = \beta_i\Omega$ be the area of the smaller triangle opposite vertex
$\hat{\mathbf v}_i$.

The formula to find $\hat{\mathbf v}$ given $\beta_i$ more complicated,
although it's also derived from the formula for solid angle given earlier.
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
  \mathbf G & \hat{\mathbf v} = \mathbf h \\
   \mathbf G & = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf g_1 & \mathbf g_2 & \mathbf g_3 \end{bmatrix} \\
   \mathbf h & = \begin{bmatrix} h_1  & h_2 & h_3  \end{bmatrix}^T \\
   \mathbf g_{i} & = \left(1+\cos \Omega_{i}\right) \mathbf v_{i-1} \times
   \mathbf v_{i+1} - \sin\Omega_{i}\left(\mathbf v_{i-1} + \mathbf v_{i+1}\right)\\
   h_i &= \sin\Omega_i\left(1+\mathbf v_{i-1}\cdot\mathbf v_{i+1}\right)
\end{split}\end{equation}
The subscripts loop around: 0 should be interpreted as 3, and 4 should be
interpreted as 1. To clarify, $\mathbf G$ is the 3x3 matrix where the $i$th
column is $\mathbf g_i$, and $\mathbf h$ is the column vector where the
$i$th element is $h_i$. The vector $\hat{\mathbf v}$
can be solved for using standard matrix methods.

\subsection{Great Circle}
Method 2 in geodesic dome circles, at least how Antiprism implements it
\subsection{Double Slerp}

\subsection{Naive Slerp}
This method shares with the gnomonic method an analytic form for the
transformation from Euclidean space to the sphere. It has two downsides: there is no analytic form
for the reverse transformation, and it can only be used on equilateral faces.

The Naive Slerp method on a triangular face resembles a naive extension of
spherical linear interpolation (Slerp) to barycentric coordinates, thus the
name. The Naive Slerp methods reduce to slerp on the edges of the face.

Let $\cos(w) = \mathbf v_i \cdot \mathbf v_{i+1}$ for all $i$. (As
usual, the subscripts loop around.) For triangles:
\begin{equation}
   \mathbf v^* = \sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\sin(w\beta_i)}{\sin(w)}  \mathbf v_i
\end{equation}
For quadrilaterals:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
     \mathbf v^* & = \sum_{i=1}^4\frac{\sin(w\gamma_i)}{\sin(w)} \mathbf v_i \\
\gamma_1 & = (1-x)(1-y) \\
\gamma_2 & = x(1-y) \\
\gamma_3 & = xy \\
\gamma_4 & = (1-x)y
\end{split}\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
   \mathbf v^* & = \sum_{i=1}^4\frac{s_i}{\sin^2(w)}  \mathbf v_i \\
s_1 &  = \sin (w(1-x))\sin (w(1-y)) \\
s_2 & = \sin (wx)\sin (w(1-y)) \\
s_3 & = \sin (wx)\sin (wy) \\
s_4 & = \sin (w(1-x))\sin (wy)
\end{split}\end{equation}

Because the projected edges already lie on the sphere, there is a lot of
freedom in how to adjust $\mathbf v^*$ to lie on the sphere. The
easiest is just to centrally project the vertices, that is, to normalize
$\mathbf v^*$ like we have been. Another option is to perform a parallel
projection along the face normal. (See appendix for a formula for the "normal"
to a skew face.) We need the parallel distance $p$ from the vertex to the
sphere surface in the direction of the face normal $\hat{\mathbf n}$,
such that $\hat{\mathbf v} = \mathbf v^* + p\hat{\mathbf n}$.
$p$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
   p = -\mathbf v^* \cdot \hat{\mathbf n} +
   \sqrt{1+\mathbf v^* \cdot \hat{\mathbf n}-\mathbf v^* \cdot \mathbf v^*}
\end{equation}
$p$ can also be approximated as $\widetilde{p} = 1 - \|\mathbf v^*\|
\leq p$, which is somewhat fewer operations and doesn't require
calculation of the face normal. Technically, you can project in almost any
direction, not just that of the face normal, but most other choices don't
produce anything remotely symmetric.

Sometimes the best polyhedron comes from a compromise of the central and
parallel projections. Choose a constant $k$, typically between 0 and 1, then:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf v} = \frac{\mathbf v^* + kp\mathbf c}{\|\dots\|}
\end{equation}
$p$ may be replaced by $\widetilde{p}$. If our goal is to optimize a
measurement of the polyhedron, we can do a 1-variable optimization on $k$,
which is more tractable than the multivariate optimization of the location of
every vertex.
