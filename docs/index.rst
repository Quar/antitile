Welcome to antitile's documentation!
====================================

Antitile is a package for manipulation of polyhedra and tilings using Python. 
It is designed to work with `Antiprism 
<https://github.com/antiprism/antiprism>`_ but can be used on its own.

The bulk of this package pertains to Goldberg-Coxeter operations, as described
in its own section.
