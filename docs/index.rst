Welcome to antitile's documentation!
====================================

Antitile is a package for manipulation of polyhedra and tilings using Python. 
It is designed to work with `Antiprism 
<https://github.com/antiprism/antiprism>`_ but can be used on its own.

The bulk of this package pertains to Similar Grid Subdivision (SGS), a method 
of subdividing polyhedra with triangular or quadrilateral faces. SGS can 
produce Buckminster Fuller's geodesic polyhedra and the quadrilateralized 
spherical cube used in geographic information systems.
